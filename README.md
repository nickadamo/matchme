MatchMe is a flashcard iOS application geared toward users with a language delay. MatchMe is a useful tool for Speech Language Pathologists as well as parents who are trying to facilitate language growth. MatchMe focuses on developing the user’s labeling skills in order to increase their vocabulary. 
	After opening MatchMe, the user has the option to login by providing existing credentials, register as a new user, or play as a guest in “Quick Play” mode with an option to sign up later. 
	Upon logging in, a list of categories is displayed. The user then selects a category from the list. After selecting a category, a list of the flashcard titles in that category is displayed. After a flashcard title is selected from the list, the corresponding flash card is displayed. When the selected flashcard is displayed, the flashcard title is displayed at top of the screen and displayed below are three images. 
	If the user matches the word with the correct picture, a celebration animation appears and the user will be awarded ten points. If the user’s selection is incorrect, the incorrect image will disappear and the user will not be awarded any points. If the user makes an incorrect attempt but makes the correct match on the second attempt, the user is awarded seven points. If the user makes two incorrect attempts, an alert will pop-up encouraging the user to navigate back to the category of flashcards and try again. A running total of the number of correct answers will be kept and displayed at the bottom of each flashcard. Each attempt (correct or incorrect, points earned and the date & time of the attempt) is recorded and stored on parse.com. After the user attempts to match each card in a specific category, a leaderboard of the highest scores will be displayed. 
	MatchMe was programmed using Xcode 5.1.1 and uses parse.com for data storage
